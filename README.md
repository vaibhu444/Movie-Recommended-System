# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using machine learning techniques. The goal is to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions.

## Project Overview
- **Name:** Movie Recommendation System
- **File:** `MovieRecommendation.ipynb`
- **Objective:** Build a recommendation engine to predict movies users might like.
- **Approach:** The system leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches to generate recommendations.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Personalized movie recommendations

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `MovieRecommendation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the cells in order to preprocess data, train the model, and generate recommendations.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Collect movie data and user ratings.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and normalize the data.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the dataset.
4. **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model to predict user preferences.
5. **Recommendation:** Generate movie recommendations based on the trained model.

## Evaluation
The system evaluates performance using metrics like:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Precision and Recall
- Mean Average Precision (MAP)

## Results
The notebook outputs top movie recommendations for individual users and visualizes key metrics to demonstrate model performance.
